excerpt: Taipei wasn't 100% perfect; there were definitely things we didn't love.

Nowhere in the world is perfect, and the longer you spend in a location the more you get to know it's faults. There are many things that really annoy me about Boston (see [a partial list by Rachel](/blog/2014/03/boston-observations.html), but that doesn't mean I don't still love my city.

Taipei has a few things that are definitely not ideal, most having to do with the traffic. But on balance the good in Taipei still far, far outweighs the bad.

## Few Sidewalks

Major roads in Taipei have sidewalks, but the vast majority do not. As a pedestrian you keep to the edge of the road - where "edge of road" means "farther away from the buildings than the legion of parked scooters".

Much of the time you're literally sharing what should be a single lane of traffic with cars, trucks, scooters, and other pedestrians, having to duck between parked scooters from time to time. And many of these drivers are moving faster than I personally am comfortable with.

The first week it was very unnerving, and it never got much better. Rachel and I compensated by finding the alleys and roads that were either too narrow for anyone to drive much more than 5mph or big enough to have sidewalks, but that only worked for city areas that we knew really well.

## Scooters. Everywhere.

There must be laws about where scooters can and can't go, and I bet they're something like this:

> By order of the President of Taiwan, a scooter can go any-damn-where it pleases.

Sidewalks, alleys (including alleys barely large enough for two people to walk abreast, like night markets), highways, major roads: homes for scooters.

![Seriously?](http://images108.fotki.com/v1629/photos/3/413153/12806455/2014021512_51_17-vi.jpg)

The only solace I take in the ubiquity of scooters is that at least they're not driving cars. I'm willing to put up with some scooter annoyance for that.

![As far as I can tell, this small park is the only place in all of Taipei - possibly including people's private apartments - that scooters are not allowed.](http://images61.fotki.com/v665/photos/3/413153/12820227/2014022212_07_03-vi.jpg)

## Crossing Streets is Crazy

Most reasonably significant road crossings are metered by lights. You actually get a countdown when your light is red, which is pretty awesome.

When a pedestrian walk signal turns green it's typically at the same time that traffic is moving in the parallel direction. So cars trying to make a right or left have to contend with pedestrians that have the green walk symbol.

Cars and scooters - especially scooters - do not wait for pedestrians to exit the crosswalk. They gun through gaps as soon as they appear. Basically anything goes as long as they give pedestrians the right of way.

The experience then of crossing the street is to start moving into traffic in which cars and scooters both ahead and behind you are crossing your path as you move forward, and you keep moving with faith that the next ones will break long enough for you to go by and then shoot through the gap behind you.

I really wish I had a video of this. It's surreal.

## No Trash Cans Anywhere

This is one that I really don't understand. The city is so clean, but there are *no trash cans anywhere!* The only places that seem to have public trash cans are parks. Beyond that, trash cans are very rare.

![This was an inedible street sausage in Wulai. I put the whole thing in a plastic bag for trash I had with me and carried it around for at least another hour.](http://images14.fotki.com/v373/photos/3/413153/12823339/2014022414_24_04-vi.jpg)

We were on our feet a ton, picking up bottles of water, coffee, and snacks, and frequently had to carry around our trash for *hours* at a time. I took to keeping extra plastic bags with me to make this less plainful.

## Lines

In Taipei, if there's a line it means it's good. Conversely, if there's no line then it's bad. All the good places frequently had very long waits, and Taiwanese people do not seem to care about waiting.

![Rachel in line for delicious Japanese food.](http://images61.fotki.com/v665/photos/3/413153/12803856/2014021318_05_40-vi.jpg)

I hate lines.

We took to doing everything at weird hours to mitigate this problem. For example, our first Din Tai Fung lunch was at 2:30pm (only 30 minute wait!). We also kept a running list of restaurants to check out so that if onen place had a really long wait we could go down the list to somewhere else.

![Yes! Only 30 minutes wait for Din Tai Fung!!](http://images116.fotki.com/v715/photos/3/413153/12799461/2014021014_06_45-vi.jpg)
